Great choice ‚Äî this is a strong concept with a clean generative model and an obvious path to iterative value. Let's map out a **workplan** to get you from idea to prototype, broken down into *core phases* with technical checkpoints and optional enhancements.

---

### üß± **Phase 1: Core Dungeon Generator Logic (no UI yet)**

**Goal:** Build the core random walk algorithm in Python that generates a basic dungeon layout as data (e.g., grid, graph, or list of rooms/halls).

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Define data structures:
  - `Room`, `Hallway`, `Door`, etc.
  - Use `@dataclass` for easy management.
- [ ] Create a `DungeonAgent` that:
  - Starts at an origin point.
  - Picks exits at random.
  - Places a room/hallway on the other side.
  - Tracks explored vs. unexplored paths.
- [ ] Prevent overlap or looping:
  - Maintain a spatial grid or coordinate system.
  - Use a dict or 2D array to track positions.
- [ ] Add randomness modifiers:
  - Chance of hallway vs. room.
  - Room size variance, trap/npc/treasure presence.

‚úÖ **Deliverable:** A CLI script that prints an abstract dungeon map (textual or grid-style).

### üß† **Phase 2: Flavor Generation with AI**

**Goal:** Add narrative flair using GPT-style LLM to generate room descriptions, NPC motives, treasure flavor, etc.

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Define prompt templates for:
  - Room description based on type/size.
  - Traps, treasures, and encounters.
  - Optional system flavor (e.g., "OSE" vs "Knave").
- [ ] Create `generate_flavor()` function:
  - Takes dungeon element data as input.
  - Returns LLM-generated flavor text.
- [ ] Store both structure and flavor in output.

‚úÖ **Deliverable:** A dungeon printout that includes GPT-flavored descriptions.

### üñºÔ∏è **Phase 3: Streamlit UI**

**Goal:** Build a simple Streamlit app to view and generate dungeons.

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create Streamlit layout:
  - Sidebar: system, size, danger level inputs.
  - Main: dungeon map (grid or list) and text output.
- [ ] Display map as:
  - ASCII-style grid, or
  - Graph (using NetworkX, Plotly, or simple HTML/CSS grid).
- [ ] Add a ‚ÄúGenerate Dungeon‚Äù button.

‚úÖ **Deliverable:** Interactive app that lets users generate and view flavored dungeons.

### üå± **Phase 4: Optional Enhancements**

- **Mapping Enhancements**
  - Grid-based visualizer.
  - Export to image or printable PDF.
- **Modular System Plugins**
  - Templates per OSR system (e.g., stat block formats).
- **Session Seeding Mode**
  - Generate a full session starter with hooks, factions, and quests.
- **Dungeon Save/Share**
  - Store generated dungeons as JSON or shareable links.

### ‚õèÔ∏è Suggested Tech Stack

| Component       | Tech               |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Backend Logic  | Python (dataclasses, random, etc.) |
| AI Integration | OpenAI API (GPT-4-turbo) |
| UI             | Streamlit          |
| Visualization  | ASCII, NetworkX, or Plotly |
| Data Storage   | JSON (for now)     |
